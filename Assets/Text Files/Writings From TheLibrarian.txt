Hello John,

I understand you might be quite confused as to why you are here. (I am too.). Right now you are the simplest form of what you are. I know that may not make sense, seeing as you do not remember any of it. Rest assured, you are in safe hands with me.
I am the Librarian here, and I will be handling your progression. Please don't hesitate to 

Now that you are more acquainted, which way is up? Have you any clue what you are doing here yet?
